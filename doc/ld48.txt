    LUDUM DARE 48
    Theme: Deeper and deeper

    Ideas:

- You are a wizard.
- Going down a dungeon.
- Each floor (start on floor 0, every level is -1, so floor -1, -2, -3, etc.)
- Funny story, if I have time.

    Ideas, but maybe not for this game:

- Mining game, either like a submarine, or an astronaut
- Earn score by collecting rare ores.
- Too basic : (

- Programmer game.. Like going deeper and deeper into code?
- not sure what to do with it..
- would have developer jokes

Probably I'll go with the 1st theme, the one with the wizard.
